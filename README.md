# FileCOAuto
File Create or Open Automation script. For work there is an annoying task that involves opening a deeply embedded file in the File Explorer on windows. I wrote a .bat file [could be better with PowerShell *.cmd] to preform the processes.

### Script does not display directory information from company. Under the GNU License this is open-source, but I do not give consent to anyone due to the nature of the script. Purely for personal use.
